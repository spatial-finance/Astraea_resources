## Image t-SNE live

[A complete guide to this application can be found here](http://ml4a.github.io/guides/ImageTSNELive/)

To build from source, the following addons are required:
- [ofxAssignment](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxAssignment)
- [ofxCcv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCcv)
- [ofxJSON](https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON)
- [ofxTSNE](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxTSNE)

This app lets you view a t-SNE of images, as well as its corresponding grid assignment. It is a superset of all the functionality of [ImageTSNEViewer](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-ofx/tree/master/apps/ImageTSNEViewer), inheriting the basic viewer and export functionality, while also allowing for the actual analysis and t-SNE assignment to be done within the app itself. It is entirely compatible with the export in ImageTSNEViewer and can also load a JSON file generated by ImageTSNEViewer's  analysis script (in Python), or a JSON file generated by the associated guide, [image-tsne](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-guides/blob/master/notebooks/image-tsne.ipynb).
