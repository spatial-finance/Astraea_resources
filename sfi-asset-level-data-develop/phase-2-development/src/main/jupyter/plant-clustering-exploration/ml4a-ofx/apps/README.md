# Applications

Specific instructions for running each application are included in a README inside each app folder. A description of each application follows:

#### AudioClassifier

Train a classifier on microphone audio recordings.

#### AudioTSNEViewer

View a collection of audio samples organized via t-SNE on extracted audio features. Works both on a collection (folder) of individual files, or a single audio file which can is segmented by onsets or beats.

#### ConvnetClassifier

Train an image classifier on a webcam feed.

#### ConvnetRegressor

Train an image regression on a webcam feed.

#### ConvnetPredictor

(in progress) This app combines ConvnetRegressor and ConvnetClassifier into one app with an interface. This should eventually replace the former two.

#### ConvnetViewer

View the activations of a trained convnet. 

#### DoodleClassifier

Similar to convnet classifier, but optimized toward classifying images of hand-drawings.

#### FaceClassifier

Train a model and do real time classification of face poses.

#### FaceDTW

Perform facial gestures over time and classify them using Dynamic Time Warping.

#### FaceRegressor

Train a model and do real time regression of face poses.

#### Gobot

Automatically scrape [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) board position from [online-go.com](https://online-go.com/) and make next move recommendations.

#### ImageTSNEViewer

View a collection of images organized via t-SNE on extracted features from a convnet, where the feature extraction is done from a python script and the results are imported into the app.

#### ImageTSNELive

The same as ImageTSNEViewer (above), but handles the feature extraction and t-SNE assignment internally, and optionally allows for assignment to grid.

#### ReverseImageSearch

Search for most similar images in an image collection, given a query image. Analyze it first, then save the results for real-time browsing.

#### ReverseImageSearchFast

Fast search and retrieval of similar images in a database to a query image, webcam feed, video, or screengrabber.

#### ReverseObjectSearchFast

Fast search and retrieval of similar images in a database to multiple objects found in a query image, webcam feed, video, or screengrabber.

#### SimpleRegression

Boiled down example showing how to train a model and do real time regression with mouse position as the input.

#### YoloLive

Do real-time object detection from 9000 classes on a webcam feed, video, or screengrabber.
